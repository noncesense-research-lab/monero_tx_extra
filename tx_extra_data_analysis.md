## Next steps
While unencrypted paymentIDs are no longer included by the core wallet, they are still allowed by the protocol, and are still occasionally in use today.  Go have some fun - leave me some new easter eggs to find. ;- ) 

However note that your transactions will be pretty easy to link (especially via the change output) if you send multiple messages from the same wallet, so be mindful. And obviously putting your name or email address in plaintext on a blockchain puts your digital and physical safety at risk, so think twice before putting PII in tx_extra (just because you *can* doesn't mean that you *should*)
